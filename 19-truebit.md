The Verifier's Dilemma
=======================

in case of a heavy transaction, what should a rational miner do?

1. skipping verification affords an advantage in the mining race. Therefore skip the verification.
2. Mining on the wrong chain means that other miners will ignore a found block. Therefore do the verification.

Goals:

- anyone can offer a reward for performing a computational task
- anyone can solve a task in exchange for a reward
- the ptotocol guarantees correctness of solutions
- anyone includes smart contracts & identities
