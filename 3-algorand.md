Algorand & Bitcoin = digital signatures and random (?) hashing

Bitcoin power is concentrated in 5 mining pools (which pools?)

Problem: known locations + low margins = easy corruption

Algorand = Effortless one by one byzantine Agreement

no forks or proof work

Byzantine agreement = communcation protocol that guarantees agreement and consistency

honest majority of money

no eventually consistency, prob[fork] <= 10^-18

random users are chosen to decide on next blocks
random commitees

cryptographic lottery with proof then election via BA proof

new BA algorithm: worst case = n <= 9, best case = 1

new committee for each step of BA algorithm

examples:

- ouroburos
- sleepy consensus

no battle plan survives the first shot
