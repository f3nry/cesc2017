Governance
========

Governance on-chain is difficult

tezos and dfinity are aiming to solve on-chain governance

competition between types of keepers is healthy

Keepers represent a massive opportunity for technical investors

web3 will reorganize intelligence and capital (both machine and human)

Keeper Categories
=========

Gatekeepers of trust: trusted nodes that validate transactions or actions of other network actors
Arbitrage: look for imbalances and profit from opportunities
Resource-Transactional: open architecture miners that trade one resource for another (Filecoin, golem)
