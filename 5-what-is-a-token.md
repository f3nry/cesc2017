What is a token?
==============
Sinclair Davidson

From RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub

DAO = organization made of software

Tokens are not money, just a finnancial instrument used to incentize actions.

Blockchain is an institutional technology, lowering information cost.

Before 2009 = goverment, firms, market

after 2009 = goverment, blockchain, firms, markets

Contract types
===========

Plan (we'll figure it all out beforehand)
Promise (I'll do it I swear!)
Competition (short term contracting, milkbaring)
Governance (ownership)

============

blockchain solves for promise contracts

Bounded rationality

human mind is an economic resource that jumps to conclusions

opportunism = self-interest, lying, stealing, deceit
calculated efforts to mislead

asset specificity = types of assets (humans, site, token, money, etc)

PLanning = opportunism, asset specifity
promose = bounded rationality, asset specifity

blockchain limits opportunism, moving from governance to promise

governance problems: agency, promoters

institutional cryptoeconomics
========

?? Positive theory of agency

williamson: debt and equity are governance mechanism; debt is hard, equity is soft

equtiy is discretionary

tokens are equity, not money (some cryptocurrencies are to valuable to use in day to day micro transactions)

tokens are an asset class

ICOs are IPOs with coin instead of stocks
    - still have promotor problem

regulators will be disrupted as much as the industries they regulate

questions
========

what happened in 2009?
